# Infernal Menagerie

Step into [Baalhorn the Goat's](https://warpcast.com/baalhorn) blockchain petting zooâ€”a haunting collection of cursed creatures, where visitors can interact with Baalhorn and his kin.

In [Farcastle](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/farcastle), the Infernal Menagerie is no ordinary exhibition. It is a nexus of bound magic and untamed mystery, where majestic and monstrous beasts are held in tenuous balance. These creatures, each marked by the dark fate that brought them to the castle, now exist as living lore for all who dare approach.

Here, the Menagerie serves as a living archive of Farcastle's arcane history. Each cursed beast tells a tale, whispering secrets of ancient pacts, broken oaths, and the powers that bind them. Visitors are beckoned to explore not just the creatures themselves, but the veiled truths they represent, interacting with their essence through the blockchain.

This is a place of wonder and forewarning, a testament to Farcastle's belief that even the most feral and cursed among us contribute to the eternal story of the castle's will.
